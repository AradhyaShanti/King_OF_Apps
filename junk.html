    <h1><pre>"Junk food" is a term used to describe food that is high in calories from sugar and/or fat, and possibly sodium, but
    with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important forms of nutritional value.[1][2][3] It is
    also known as HFSS food (high in fat, salt and sugar).[4] The term junk food is a pejorative dating back to the
    1950s.[5]
    
    Precise definitions vary by purpose and over time. Some high-protein foods, like meat prepared with saturated fat, may
    be considered junk food.[6] Fast food and fast food restaurants are often equated with junk food, although fast foods
    cannot be categorically described as junk food.[7][8][9] Most junk food is highly processed food.
    
    Concerns about the negative health effects resulting from a junk food-heavy diet, especially obesity, have resulted in
    public health awareness campaigns, and restrictions on advertising and sale in several countries.[10][11][12] Current
    studies indicate that a diet high in junk food can increase the risk of depression, digestive issues, heart disease and
    stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and early death.[13]</pre></h1>
