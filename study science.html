        Science is a neutral, rigorous, systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable

        explanations and predictions about the universe.[1][2] Modern science is typically divided into three major branches:[3]
        natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g.,
        
        economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies;[4][5] and the formal sciences (e.g.,
        logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules.[6][7]

        There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines,[8][9][10] because they do not rely on
        empirical evidence.[11][9] Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such
        as in engineering and medicine.[12][13][14]
        
        The history of scientific discipline spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest written records of
        identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to Bronze Age Egypt and Mesopotamia from around 3000 to 1200 BCE.
        Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical

        antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural
        causes, while further advancements, including the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, were made during the
        Golden Age of India.[15]: 12 [16] [17][18] Scientific research deteriorated in these regions after the fall of the

        Western Roman Empire and Gupta empire during the early middle ages (400 to 1000 CE,) but was preserved and expanded upon
        in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age[19] and later by the efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who brought
        Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe in the Renaissance.
