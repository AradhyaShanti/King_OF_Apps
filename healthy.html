    <h1>A healthy diet is a diet that maintains or improves overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with essential
    nutrition: fluid, macronutrients such as protein, micronutrients such as vitamins, and adequate fibre and food
    energy.[2][3]
    
    A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food or
    sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based
    foods, although additional sources of vitamin B12 are needed for those following a vegan diet.[4] Various nutrition
    guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be
    healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on
    the components relevant to health.[5][6]</h1>
